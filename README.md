# 🎨 PowerShell Profile (Pretty PowerShell)

A stylish and functional PowerShell profile that looks and feels almost as good as a Linux terminal.

## ⚡ One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

```
irm "https://github.com/natep-tech/powershell-profile/raw/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

## 🛠️ Fix the Missing Font

After running the script, you'll find a downloaded `cove.zip` file in the folder you executed the script from. Follow these steps to install the required nerd fonts:

1. Extract the `cove.zip` file.
2. Locate and install the nerd fonts.

Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! 🚀

# TODO List

- [ ] Create a Functions folder and move each to its own file: 
	```
	Function load_my_functions {
	$functiondir = "$env:USERPROFILE\functions" 
	gci (split-path $functiondir) -filter 'func_*.ps1' -recurse | foreach-object { . $_ }
	}

	New-Alias -Name lf -Value load_my_functions
	```
- [ ] Add Connection segment to OhMyPosh theme.
